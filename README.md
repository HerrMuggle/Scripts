## Introduction
This repository includes several useful scripts for managing and automating different tasks. Each script serves a specific function, such as:
- Automating system maintenance tasks
- Network scanning with Nmap
- File management and backups
- Security auditing tools

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have the necessary tools installed, such as bash, python, nmap, or others depending on the script.
- If you are using a Linux-based system (like Ubuntu), most of the required tools are already available or can be easily installed.

# Daily Log Report Script

This script is used to collect and email critical system logs from your Ubuntu server every 24 hours. It checks system logs for important events, such as system errors and service failures, and sends the relevant logs to a specified email address.

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

You need the `mail` command installed on your server to send the emails. Install it using the following command:

Make sure you have the following installed on your Ubuntu server:

1. **Mail Utility**: To send emails.
   - Install `mail` using the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install mailutils
     ```

2. **Cron**: The script uses a cron job to run automatically every day.
   - Cron is usually pre-installed on Ubuntu, but you can check if it's installed with:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install cron
     ```
```bash
sudo apt-get install mailutils
